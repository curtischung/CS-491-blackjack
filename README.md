Final Project Blackjack

DOCUMENTATION: <br />  <br />
  All files are stored in github and are built in github.  <br />
  Testings should be fully automated on a commit to the repository from the actions tab of github.  <br />
   If all testing passes, then it should be build and zipped up as a release version on the releases tab.  <br />
  There are no special instructions or documentations, once you commit, it should automatically test and create a new version.  <br />
