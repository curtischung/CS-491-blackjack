#Final Project Blackjack

##DOCUMENTATION: <br />  <br />
  All files are stored in github and are built in github. 
  
  [Github](https://github.com/curtischung/CS-491-blackjack) All code is available on github.
  
  
  When a commit is done on the github repository, it should automatically run the workflow of building and testing the application. <br />
  Testing is done in the workflow of github in python-app.yml whenever a commit is done on the main branch. <br />
  The deployment is done on Heroku, where it functions the same as the workflow testing. It deploys to heroku whenever a commit is done to the repository, and we can see the deployment succeed or fail in the environments tab of github.  <br />
  
  
  [Heroku Deploy](https://git.heroku.com/blackjackcs491.git) <br />
  The link doesn't really show anything, but the application itself is deployed, it's just there's no interface to properly display the blackjack game.
