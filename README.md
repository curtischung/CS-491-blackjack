Final Project Blackjack

DOCUMENTATION:
  All files are stored in github and are built in github. 
  Testings should be fully automated on a commit to the repository from the actions tab of github.
   If all testing passes, then it should be build and zipped up as a release version on the releases tab.
  There are no special instructions or documentations, once you commit, it should automatically test and create a new version.
